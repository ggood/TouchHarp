TouchHarp
=========

A musical instrument, with touch sensitive "strings" played like a harp.
It currently uses the touch sensing inputs on a Teensy 3.0/3.1
microcontroller, along with an analog multiplexer to expand the number
of touch sense inputs on the Teensy.

Given that now there are breakouts for the Freescale MPR121 capacitive
touch sensor (https://www.adafruit.com/products/1982), I will be
rewriting the code to use that instead.
